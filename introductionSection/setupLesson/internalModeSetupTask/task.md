# Setup

To access some internal actions, you need to enable `Internal Mode`.
Please follow the steps in the internal mode instruction configuration [at this link](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/enabling-internal.html) and enable it in your IDE.

**Do not forget to restart you IDE after changing the idea.properties file!!!**

Also, the following GIF will show you how Helena did this in her IDE.
