# Task 1/2: Introducing Helena

Hi! My name is Helena. I’m working in the Plugin Development Team. We have just hired a new young developer, Jonsi, so I’ve prepared lots of amazing projects for him to do.

But wait, he has never worked with IntelliJ Platform before?! So well, I’ll try to teach him all important things during one week of his probation.

Say hello to Helena! Add implementation to method `helloHelena` method which should return “Hello, Helena!” given number of times, separated by new line.
