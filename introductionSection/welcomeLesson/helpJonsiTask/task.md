Hi! My name is Jonsi! It’s my first day at JetBrains, and I’m ready to get started! But I’m really nervous about my probation week, since I have no idea how an IDE works behind the scenes, and what's more, I don't know how to write plugins for it.

So, I really need someone's help!!!

Maybe you can help me?
