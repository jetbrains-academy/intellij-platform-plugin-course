Hi! My name is Helena. I’m working in the Plugin Development Team. We have just hired a new young developer, Jonsi, so I’ve prepared lots of amazing projects for him to tackle.

But wait, he has never worked with the IntelliJ Platform before?! Well, I’ll try to teach him all the important things during the one week of his probation.
