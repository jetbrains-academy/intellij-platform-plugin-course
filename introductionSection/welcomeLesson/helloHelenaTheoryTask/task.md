Hi! My name is Helena. I’m working in the Plugin Development Team. We have just hired a new young developer, Jonsi, so I’ve prepared lots of amazing projects for him to do.

But wait, he has never worked with IntelliJ Platform before?! So well, I’ll try to teach him all important things during one week of his probation.
