Follow a `useful tools` link in [PSI Documentation main page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/psi.html)
and find an action which provides an ability to see and analyze PSI tree of opened file.

and select PSI elements presented in it?

<div class="hint" title="How to find PSI Viewer?">

Use `Tools | View PSI Structure of Current File...` action to access PSI tree
