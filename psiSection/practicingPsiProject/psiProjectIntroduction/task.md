**Welcome to the Final Project!**

Throughout this course, you've mastered the fundamentals and tackled various challenges that have prepared you for this momentâ€”the creation of your very own plugin for JetBrains Academy's IDE.

# Project Overview

**Objective:** Your task is to develop a backend for a plugin that focuses on the process of extracting all arguments from a given function into a new data class, subsequently replacing the original function arguments with an instance of this class.

This approach not only cleans up the function signature but also enhances code readability and maintainability.
