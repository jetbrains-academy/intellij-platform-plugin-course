Every Kotlin function can be defined with a set of parameters (arguments) it accepts. These parameters are essential for the function's operation, allowing it to receive and manipulate data.

**Your Objective**:

Implement the `extractFunctionArguments` function to return a list of the parameters (`KtParameter`) of a provided Kotlin function (`KtNamedFunction`).

This will involve analyzing the `ktNamedFunction` object to extract its parameters.

**Run Plugin**

To see your implemented methods in action within a UI, run the following command in your project's root directory:

* ` ./gradlew :psiSection-practicingPsiProject-task:runIde
  ` on Linux or MacOS.
* ` gradlew :psiSection-practicingPsiProject-task:runIde
  ` on Windows.
