Sometimes, you want to make you code more searchable and sort methods by the alphabetical order. 
Now you can do it automatically, just several lines of code!
Implement method which takes PSI class and orders all inner methods in alphabetical order.


<div class="hint" title="Where to start?">

Get list of class methods, **copy** them and sort list of copies by name. Then use **replace** original methods one by one with copy which should stand in this position in sorted order.
