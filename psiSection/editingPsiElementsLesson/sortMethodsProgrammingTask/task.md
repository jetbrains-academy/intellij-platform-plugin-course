Sometimes, you want to make you code more searchable and sort methods by the alphabetical order.
Now you can do it automatically, just several lines of code!
Implement `sortMethods` function which takes PSI class and orders all inner methods in alphabetical order.


<div class="hint" title="Where to start?">

Get list of class methods, **copy** them and sort list of copies by name. Then use **replace** original methods one by one with copy which should stand in this position in sorted order.
</div>

**Run Plugin**

To see your implemented methods in action within a UI, run the following command in your project's root directory:

* ` ./gradlew :psiSection-editingPsiElementsLesson-task:runIde
  ` on Linux or MacOS
* ` gradlew :psiSection-editingPsiElementsLesson-task:runIde
  ` on Windows
