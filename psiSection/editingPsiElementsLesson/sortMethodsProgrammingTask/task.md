Sometimes, you want to make your code more searchable by sorting methods in alphabetical order.
Now, you can do it automatically with just a few lines of code!
Implement the `sortMethods` function, which takes a PSI class and orders all inner methods alphabetically.


<div class="hint" title="Where to start?">

Get the list of class methods, **copy** them, and sort the list of copies by name. Then, **replace** the original methods one by one with the copy that should stand in the sorted order.
</div>

**Run Plugin**

To see your implemented methods in action within a UI, run the following command in your project's root directory:

* ` ./gradlew :psiSection-editingPsiElementsLesson-task:runIde
  ` on Linux or MacOS.
* ` gradlew :psiSection-editingPsiElementsLesson-task:runIde
  ` on Windows.
