# Try PSI Viewer

---
Follow a `useful tools` link in [PSI Documentation main page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/psi.html)
and find an action which provides an ability to see and analyze PSI tree of opened file.

Now, Iâ€™d want you, **Jonsi**, to look at to PSI tree of [Person.kt](courseSection/psi/Try PSI Viewer/src/Person.kt) file
and select PSI elements presented in it?

<div class="hint">
Use Tools | View PSI Structure of Current File... action to access PSI tree
