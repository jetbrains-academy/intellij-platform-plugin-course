It is an example of framework lessons. 
If you create this type of lesson, the user can solve tasks step-by-step.
Initially the user see all visible files from the first task in the lesson.
Next, all changes which were made by the user in the visible files, 
will be propagated to the next tasks.

Beginning from the second lesson you can modify the visible files to be able to provide 
students with the correct solution from the course author. 
Invisible files can be modified between tasks.

**Note, you need to have the same set of the files between all tasks.** 
So, it is the same for the resources folder, to avoid double-storing of images, 
you can put them into the `common` module:

<p align="center">
    <img src="../../../common/src/main/resources/images/logo.png" alt="Logo" width="400"/>
</p>
