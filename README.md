This course is designed for novices in plugin development for JetBrains IDEs. It covers the basics of plugin development and provides a hands-on experience in working with PSI (Program Structure Interface) elements.
The main goal of the course is not to rewrite the existing documentation, but rather to cover popular topics and provide links to the official documentation, so that the students can get used to reading the documentation and searching for the necessary information.

Each lesson of the course consist of a  theoretical task and a few programming tasks. The  theoretical tasks are designed to help you understand the topic, while the programming tasks aim to apply the acquired knowledge.
At the end of each chapter, an additional final project will be offered. It includes all the topics of the lesson but does not contain theory part. It is divided into multiple tasks, and by completing them step by step, you will get a finished small project in the end.

Topics covered:
* Accessing PSI elements
* Modifying PSI elements
* Building PSI elements
